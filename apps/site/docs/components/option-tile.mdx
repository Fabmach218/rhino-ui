# OptionTile

**Make a Radio or Checkbox look like anything!**

An OptionTile is an alternative to certain radio, checkbox, or select UIs, where a user is
presented with a more stylized version of these in the form of
a tile, or group of tiles. The OptionTile contains an accessibly hidden input element,
that will either be a `checkbox` or a `radio` input. For a
slightly more opinionated, and fully functional fieldset using the `OptionTile` see
[OptionTileGroup](?path=/docs/components-optiontilegroup-overview--default-story).

<Default />

## Props


## Input Types

The tile can be rendered as a radio (for single select) or a checkbox (for multi-select).
The default is a radio.

<InputTypes />

# More Styling Options

Some basic styles are included by default, which can all be overwritten via props. The component uses a `Box` as a root element,
and as such `BoxProps` can be used to style it.

NOTE: We do include a selected, disabled, and error states that are hardcoded but they ONLY
affect the radio/checkbox icons. These elements have an opinionated style using `primary` brand color.
If this creates a mismatch with your preferred styling, you can choose to hide them with the `hideInput`
prop, and if necessary recreate them any way you wish via `children`.
Also note that these icons are only there for visual feedback, as the true inputs are accessibly hidden.

## Component Design Tokens

This component shares component design tokens with all form controls. For a complete list of tokens, see the [Theming Form Controls documentation](/docs/theming-form-controls--custom-theme-form).

If you require theming for this component separately of other form controls, it also includes the following component specific tokens:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>token name</th>
      <th>global form control token</th>
      <th>default</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <DesignTokens />
  </tbody>
</table>
