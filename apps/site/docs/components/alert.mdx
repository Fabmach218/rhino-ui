# Alert

Use alerts to display feedback for users about specific actions, or states of an application.

<Alert
    title="Contact Created"
    message="The contact was saved on December 3, 2020 at 6:10pm PDT"
    variant="success"
    isClosable
    hasIcon
/>

## Props


## Variants

Alerts come in different variants based on the kind of feedback being delivered to the user. Additionally, a combination of icon, title, and message can be used depending on your content needs.

<Variants />

## With Custom JSX in the message

The alert can display any custom JSX that is passed into the `message` prop, not just a string variant.

<CustomJsx />

## With Render Function

If you prefer to pass a render function to the alert rather than a static `ReactNode`, you can pass a function
that returns a `ReactNode` to the `render` prop.

IMPORTANT: The `render` prop, will supersede the `message` prop, if both are present.

<RenderFunction />

## Closable

The alert can be made closable by passing the `isClosable` prop. Note that this only controls the presence of
the close icon, but closing actually happens programmatically with a callback passed to the `onClose` prop.
If you need custom close text, pass it in the `closeText` prop.

<Closable />

## Compact

Renders a version of the banner with less padding.

<Alert
    message="Compact Alerts have less padding"
    variant="info"
    isCompact
/>

## Custom Theme

The Alert component can be themed by base tokens, or component specific tokens.

<CustomTheme />

## Component Design Tokens

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>token name</th>
      <th>default value</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <DesignTokens />
  </tbody>
</table>
