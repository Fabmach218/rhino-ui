# FileUpload

Use FileUpload to capture files for upload in forms or elsewhere.

<FileUpload labelText="My File" id="demoFileUpload" />

## Props


## Default

<Default />

## Custom Button Text

Customize the button text with `buttonText`.

<ButtonText />

## Help Text

Use the `helpText` prop to add clarifying text adjacent to the file upload button.

<HelpText />

## Custom Icon

Customize the icon to communicate the button's intended use using `iconName`. For example, using a mobile device, pressing the button will launch the device's built in camera.

<CustomIcon />

## Without Icon

Remove the icon on the button with the handy `hasIcon` boolean.

<WithoutIcon />

## Without Button Text

The default button text for `FileUpload` is 'Upload File'. However, you can explicitely pass `null` to the `buttonText` prop to remove all text.

<WithoutButtonText />

## Variants

Light, dark, primary and white variations are available.

<Variants />

## Outlined

Use `isOutlined` to render an outline button.

<Outlined />

## Sizes

Set the size of the FileUpload button to `xs`, `sm`, `md` or `lg`. `md` is the default size.

<Sizes />

## Clearing Files

Pass a callback function `onClearFiles` to handle the click event for clearing all files from the input.
NOTE: since this is a controlled input, the callback itself will not clear any files, it is expected that
they are cleared at the top level where the `files` prop is emptied.

<ClearingFiles />

## Multiple Files

Pass the `multiple` prop to let users select multiple files to upload.
NOTE: just like a native file input, users will be expected to select multiple files in their finder/explorer
window in one go, if they simply click the button numerous times, the file input will be overwritten every time.

<MultipleFiles />

## Specify File Types

Specify the type of files accepted in the input with the `accept` prop. This is a direct passthrough to the
input's accept prop so it follows its standard behavor.

The example below only accepts image files.

<FileTypes />

## Truncate File Name

It is helpful in some UIs to shorten the display of long file names, however, it is
also good to let the user know what file they are uploading by leaving the file extension intact.
To accomplish this we simply truncate excess characters in the middle of the file name, based on the
`fileNameMaxLength` prop. Try it with a long file name, the one below is capped at 16 characters.

<TruncatedFileName />

## FullWidth

Pass the `fullWidth` prop to have your FileUpload button take up the entire width of its container.

<FullWidth />

## Disabled

Pass the `isDisabled` prop to render a disabled FileUpload.

<Disabled />

## Required

Pass the `isRequired` prop to make the `input` required. Combine with the `error` prop to
display a proper error when necessary.

<Required />

You can remove or customize the required indicator using the `requiredIndicator` prop.

<CustomRequiredIndicator />
