# Table

Use tables to render datasets.

Tables display information in a way thatâ€™s easy to scan, while making it easy to interact with individual records in a data set.

Lastly use tables when you need the ability to sort, filter and/or paginate data.

## Props


## Column

The column object allows you to configure each table column header as well as some aspects about its underlying cells.
You will pass an array of columns to your table, where each column is an object with the following properties.
NOTE: all properties in a column object are optional, but we highly recommend including a `heading` in every column.

<Column />

## Common Example

An example showcasing the props required to render a list of customers in a table. `rows` and `columns`.

<Default />

## Loading

Use the `isLoading` prop on the `<Table />` component to display an overlay that prevents user interaction. Useful for when
table data is being fetched or refreshed.

<Loading />

## Sortable

Make table columns sortable by passing the `isSortable` prop as part of the `Column` that you'd like to sort.
Sorting is completely controlled outside of our library. The table will fire an `onSort` callback when a column is sorted,
which bubbles up the click or keyboard event, along with a `sortedKey` value. The `sortedKey` refers to the `dataKey` of the column
that was sorted. E.G: if user clicks to sort the `color` column, then `sortedKey = 'color'` in the sort event.

While sorting happens fully outside of the library, meaning that the Table expects sorted data to be passed correctly to it,
It does expect to know if a column is sorted so that it can update the UI accordingly. If you pass sorted data to the table,
include the `sortedColumn` prop which comprises the following attributes:

`dataKey: string mathching the column key,`

`sortDirection: oneOf: 'none', 'ascending', 'descending'`

<Sortable />

## Sortable with Default Sorted Column

Having a column be sorted by default is no different than sorting a column, we pass the `sortedColumn` object as a prop on initial
render rather than only populating it upon user interaction.

<SortableWithDefaultSortedColumn />

## Sortable and Loading

Setting the `isLoading` prop to true will disable clicking on the column headers. This prevents a race condition where an attempt to sort is made before data from the previous load is available.

<SortableAndLoading />

## Scrollable

If you wish to lock your table into a particular `width` or `height` but render it fully (introducing scrolling) use the
`scroll` prop. It is an object with the keys:

`x: boolean,`

`y: boolean`.

Given this prop, the table will scroll horizontally, or verically basde on the width of its parent container.
Note, the table will use the standard `auto` HTML algorithm for sizing columns based on their content, unless a column
is given a specific width. In the example below we've made the table fit in a parent container that is 300x300 pixels
with the second column having a fixed width of 300 pixels.

<Scrollable />

## Scrollable with Sticky Header

Pass `hasStickyHeader` as a prop to stick the header to the top of the table, and prevent it from scrolling away.

<ScrollableWithStickyHeader />

## Scrollable with First Column Stuck to Left

To stick the first column to the left of the table when it scrolls horizontally, add `sticky: 'left` to the column's config.

<ScrollableFirstColumnLeft />

## Scrollable with Sticky Header and Nth Column Stuck to Left

Add `sticky: 'left` to any column to stick it to the left of the table when it scrolls horizontally.

<ScrollableStickyHeaderNthColumnStuckLeft />

## Scrollable with Last Column Stuck to Right

To stick the last, or any, column to the right of the table when it scrolls horizontally, add `sticky: 'right'` to the column's config.

<ScrollableLastColumnStuckRight />

## Scrollable with Sticky Header and First Column Stuck to Left, Striped, and Hoverable

To stick the header to the top, and the first column to the left, pass `hasStickyHeader` as a prop, and add `sticky: 'left'` to the column's config.

<ScrollableStickyHeaderFirstColumnStuckLeft />

## Scrollable and Loading

All interactions, including clicking and scrolling will be disabled when a scrollable table is loading.

<ScrollableAndLoading />

## Fixed-Width Columns

If you wish to lock the width of a particular column set the actual column `width` in your column object. Widths are set independently for each column.

<FixedWidthColumns />

## Fixed Table Layout

The default layout algorithm for a HTML table is `auto`. Use the `useFixedTableLayout` prop to set the table's layout algorithm to `fixed`.

<FixedTableLayout />

## Truncate Overflow

In cases where long text content is expected but displaying it fully isn't required, use the `truncateOverflow` prop on the table.
This will truncate column content, but only if a fixed width is passed to that column. NOTE: the `truncateOverflow` exists
in the `Column` object as well, making it possible to set it globally on the table or individually on a column. The column
value will supersede the global setting.

<TruncateOverflow />

## Custom Actions

The `Column` object is equiped with a `render` method. When used, the cells will render any custom JSX returned by this method. This can be used in a completely agnostic way. See `Any custom JSX` column below, where we render the same markup regardless of the cell/row content.

The render method also exposes data about the cell and row, namely:

`cell: the content in the cell,`

`row: the entire row object,`

`rowIndex: the index of the row in the table`

With this data in the render function it is possible to render complex elements inside of a single cell.
See `Based on cell/row` example below.

<CustomActions />

## Empty Cell Placeholder

The empty cell placeholder can be set on a global level as a prop on `<Table />` or individually per column
by adding the `emptyCellPlaceholder` to the column configuration object. In cases where both is set, the column
placeholder takes precedence over the global placeholder. As seen in the example below where the price column uses
`$0.00` as a placeholder where a price is missing.

<EmptyCellPlaceholder />

## Borderless

Render a borderless table by passing `isBorderless` (boolean) prop to the table.

<Borderless />

## Compact

Render a compact table by passing `isCompact` (boolean) prop to the table.

<Compact />

## Striped

Render a striped table to slightly improve readibility by passing `isStriped` (boolean) prop to the table.

<Striped />

## Hoverable

Make rows 'hoverable' by passing `hoverableRows` (boolean) prop to the table.

<Hoverable />

## Striped & Hoverable

You can combine any of these boolean props based on your UI needs.

<StripedAndHoverable />

## Aligning Cell Text

Align cell content as needed with the `align` prop. Either pass the prop at the `<Table />` level for all columns, or individually
in a single `Column` object. NOTE: right alignment is best reserved for numerical data display.
We recommend refraining from specific alignment unless it serves the data, as alignment discrepancies in different columns
may interrupt the natural reading flow for a user.

<AligningCellText />

The below is an example of setting the `align` prop globally in the `<Table />` and overwriting its value on a specific column

<GlobalAlign />

## Component as Column Header

You can use a ReactNode as your table header or cell.

<ComponentAsHeaderOrCell />


## Themed Table

<ThemedTable />

## Custom Column Classes

Add custom classes to cells in a column by passing the `cellClassName` in the column config.

<CustomCellClasses />


## Component Design Tokens

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>token name</th>
      <th>default value</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <DesignTokens />
  </tbody>
</table>
