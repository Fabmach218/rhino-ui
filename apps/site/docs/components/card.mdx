# Card

A card is a stylized Box component that acts as a container to group related information and actions.
It consists of three child components that are automatically included with the `<Card />`:

1. `<Card.Header />` - should contain a descriptive title for the Card's contents
1. `<Card.Section />` - for the body of the card, and can consists of many sections
1. `<Card.Footer />` - a place for primary actions for the card's contents

<ProfileCardExample />

## Props


## Default Card

A `<Card />` consists of three child components:

1. `<Card.Header />` - a place for descriptive title for its content
1. `<Card.Section />` - the body of the card can consists of many sections
1. `<Card.Footer />` - where primary actions are placed

<Card>
    <Card.Header title="Default Card" />
    <Card.Section>
        <p>Card content</p>
    </Card.Section>
    <Card.Footer>Footer</Card.Footer>
</Card>


## Subdued Card

Visually subdue the entire card using the `subdued` prop.


<Card subdued>
    <Card.Header title="Subdued Card" />
    <Card.Section>
        <p>Card content</p>
    </Card.Section>
</Card>


## Card Header

The `<Card.Header />` component accepts a `title` prop for setting the title of a Card. Child nodes of the card will be rendered below the title.

See [Card.Header props](#cardheader-props)

<Card>
    <Card.Header title="Default Card">
        This is a good place for card description text
    </Card.Header>
    <Card.Section>
        <p>Card content</p>
    </Card.Section>
</Card>


## Card Sections

Card sections contain the body content of the card. Give a `title` to a section to communicate distinct but related pieces of information within a `<Card />`.

See [Card.Section props](#cardsection-props)


<Card>
    <Card.Header title="Card Title" />
    <Card.Section title="Section Title">
        <p>Section content</p>
    </Card.Section>
</Card>


### Multiple Sections

Divider rules are automatically added between multiple `<Card.Section />` components.


<Card>
    <Card.Header title="Card with Multiple Sections" />
    <Card.Section title="Section A Title">
        <p>Section content</p>
    </Card.Section>
    <Card.Section title="Section B Title">
        <p>Section content</p>
    </Card.Section>
    <Card.Section>
        <p>Section c has no title</p>
    </Card.Section>
</Card>


### Subdued Section

A single section can be visually subdued using the `subdued` prop at the `<Card.Section />` level.


<Card>
    <Card.Header title="Card with Subdued Section" />
    <Card.Section subdued>
        <Box as="p">Subdued section</Box>
    </Card.Section>
    <Card.Section>
        <Box as="p">Another section that is not subdued</Box>
    </Card.Section>
</Card>


## Card Footer

The footer of the card should contain primary actions related to the card's contents.

See [Card.Footer props](#cardfooter-props)


<Card>
    <Card.Section>content</Card.Section>
    <Card.Footer>
        <Button variant="primary">Publish</Button>
    </Card.Footer>
</Card>


## Examples

Here are some common use cases of `<Card />`.

### Sign Up Form

<SignUpForm />

### Card With Table

<CardWithTable />

### Full Bleed Photo

<FullBleedPhoto />

## Single-Instance Styling

Occasionally, you may want to customize a single instance of a `Card`, but still have the ability to manage the appearance of all other Card instances through its component design token values. We allow single-instance overrides through the use of BoxProps.

<SingleInstanceStyling />

## Component Design Tokens

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>token name</th>
      <th>default value</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <DesignTokens />
  </tbody>
</table>
