# SelectInput

Allows users to pick a value from a predefined list of options. Ideally, it should be used when there are 5 or more options, otherwise you should consider using a radio group instead.

_NOTE:_ This component is build on top of `react-select` and as such you can use any available prop from that component here as well. For a full list
of react-select props, [Click Here](https://react-select.com/props).

## Props


## Default

All that is required to render a basic version of the SelectInput is a unique `id`, a `label`, a list of options passed to the `options` prop, a `value`, and an onchange event handler passed to the `onChange` prop.

<Default />

## Pre-Selected

Pre-select an option by passing its value to the `value` prop.

<PreSelected />

## Help Text

Use the `helpText` prop to add clarifying text beneath the input label.

<HelpText />

## Placeholder

Use the `placeholder` prop to add a custom placeholder.

<Placeholder />

## Hidden Label

Use the `hideLabel` prop to not render the label.

<HiddenLabel />

## Multi-Select

Use the `isMulti` prop to allow the selection of multiple options.

<MultiSelect />

## Multi-Select and Pre-Selected

Use the `isMulti` prop combined with passing one or more options in an array to the `value` prop to pre-select option(s).

<MultiSelectAndPreSelected />

## Autofocus

Use the `autoFocus` prop to autofocus a SelectInput.

<Autofocus />

## Required

Use the `isRequired` prop to mark the input as required.

<Required />

## Disabled

Use the `isDisabled` prop to mark the input as disabled.

<Disabled />

## Clearable

Use the `isClearable` prop to allow clearing of the input selected option. NOTE: this works by passing `null`
to the `onChange` handler.

<Clearable />

## Error

Use the `error` prop to mark the input as invalid. `error` accepts a `boolean`, `string`, or `node`. If either a `string` or `node` is passed, a validation message is displayed below it.

<Error />

## Sizes

Set the size of the input to `sm`, `md` or `lg`. `md` is the default size.
The `size` prop is also a `ResponsiveProp`, so it can be sized differently at each [breakpoint](?path=/docs/design-tokens-design-tokens--page#breakpoints) by passing an object.

<Sizes />

## With Portal

In many cases it is helpful to render the select dropdown in a portal to avoid cutoff from a smaller container.
We maintain the react-select API here where the `menuPortalTarget` prop is used. This is a ref to the element
being portaled to. In the example below we would see our dropdown menu be cutoff by the storybook story container,
if we did not portal it to the body element.

<Portal />

## Custom Classes

Use the `className` prop to add a custom class, or classes to an input.

<CustomClasses />

## Component Design Tokens

This component shares component design tokens with all form controls. For a complete list of tokens, see the [Theming Form Controls documentation](/docs/theming-form-controls--custom-theme-form).
