# TextLink

Use links to direct a user to a new location. Can be use for in-app navigation via [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/)
or anchor tag based links.

## Props

When the `href` is set, the `TextLink` accepts all valid [HTML anchor element attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a), such as `_target`.

When `to` is set, the `TextLink` accepts all [React Router Link](https://reactrouter.com/web/api/Link) props.


## Default

All that is required to render a basic version of a TextLink is `children` which will contain text
or a ReactNode to be rendered as well as an `href` attribute. `TextLink` will render an anchor tag automatically
when given an `href`, and you can use the same exact API as a traditional anchor, as seen here:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a


<TextLink href="http://rhinolabs.agency">Click me!</TextLink>;


## With React Router

If you're doing in-app navigation and need to render a [React Router Link](https://reactrouter.com/web/api/Link) component,
simply use React Router's `component` prop on the `Link` component. All Link props will be passed down to the anchor tag.

<ReactRouter />

## With Attributes & Other Props

Whether you're using React Router or just displaying an anchor tag, you can follow the native
APIs for each option

<AdditionalAttributes />

<LinkProps />

## In the middle of a paragraph

Text links are often used to highlight clickable text inside of a larger block of copy.
You can use our text link in this manner as well.

<InsideParagraph />

The font size is inherited by its parent.

<InheritedFontSize />

## Color Variations

Text link is available in the standard `primary` variant as well as `danger`. Pass the `variant` prop
to render en either of these.

<ColorVariations />
