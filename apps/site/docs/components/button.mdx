# Button

Buttons are used as triggers for actions.
They are used in forms, toolbars, modal dialogs and as stand-alone action triggers.
Actions almost always occur on the same page.

<Button onClick={() => alert('clicked')}>Button</Button>

## Props

## Color Variants

The `variant` prop determines which color variant to render.

<Variants />

## Outlined

Use `isOutlined` to render an outline button. This is helpful for adding a secondary CTA in an application which matches
the color of the primary CTA but makes the hierarchy clear. The background is transparent in the default state.

<Outlined />

## Sizes

Set the size of the button to `xs`, `sm`, `md` or `lg`. `md` is the default size. The button also takes a `ResponsiveProp` object
so it can have different sizes at different breakpoints.

<Sizes />

## Naked

When you need a button with no styles but want to use utility classes.

<Naked />

## Full Width

Use the `fullWidth` prop to allow the button to grow to its container's full width.

<FullWidth />

## Icons

Add an icon to the left or right inside the Button using the `iconPrefix` and `iconSuffix` props respectively.

<Icons />

## Icon Only Button

Use a combination of `isNaked` and an named icon to make an icon a button. Be sure to include an `aria-label` for screen readers to know what action the button will perform when pressed.

<Button iconPrefix="remove" isNaked aria-label="remove" />

## Loading

Setting the `isLoading` prop to true will replace the button text with loading indicator and disable the button to prevent unintended submissions.
The width of the button will remain consistent to prevent content from shifting.

<Button isLoading>Sign In</Button>

## Disabled

Use for actions that arenâ€™t currently available, such as immediately after a form submission.
The interface should make it clear why the button is disabled and what needs to be done to enable it.

<Button isDisabled>Disabled Button</Button>

## Event Callbacks

Callback functions can be passed to `onClick`, `onBlur`, and `onFocus` events.

<Button
  onBlur={() => console.log('blur')}
  onClick={() => console.log('click')}
  onFocus={() => console.log('focus')}
>
  click, focus, blur events
</Button>

## As an Anchor

You can render an anchor tag with the style of a button by using the `as` prop. You
can render buttons as one of `button`, `a`, and `input`.

<Button as="a" href="https://ux.rhinolabs.agency" target="_blank">
  I'm an anchor tag
</Button>

## Wrapped in a React Router Link

<ReactRouterLink />

## Custom Theme

The Button component can be themed by base tokens, or component specific tokens. This example shows how we style our `Button` with our brand font and squared corners for use on our public marketing site.

<CustomTheme />

## Component Design Tokens

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>token name</th>
      <th>default value</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <DesignTokens />
  </tbody>
</table>
