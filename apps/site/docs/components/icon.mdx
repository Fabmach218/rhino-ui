# Icon

Icons are used to visually communicate product functionality and actions.
Use an icon only when it provides additional clarity or is necessary to draw attention to an element.

<Icon name="star" />

## Props


## Size

The size of the icon can be set on the Icon itself, or inherited from its parent's `fontSize`.
This allows for easy placement inside of other components.

<Size />

## Color

Similar to sizing, the color of the icon can be set on the Icon itself, or inherited from its parent.

## Unknown Icon

If a given icon name is not found in the dictionary, a red box with question marks will be displayed, as well as log an error to the console.
