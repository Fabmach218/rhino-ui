# Icon

Icons are used to visually communicate product functionality and actions.
Use an icon only when it provides additional clarity or is necessary to draw attention to an element.

<Icon name="star" />

The size of the icon can be set on the Icon itself, or inherited from its parent's `fontSize`.
This allows for easy placement inside of other components.
