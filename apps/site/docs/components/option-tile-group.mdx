# OptionTileGroup

Use a OptionTileGroup when a user is required to select one of five or fewer options. It is ideal for this scenario because the options are displayed without having to interact.
If there are more than five options, use the [SelectInput](?path=/docs/components-selectinput-overview--default-story) instead.

<Default />

## Props


## MultiSelect

When a user needs to select more than one element, the underlying inputs will be checkboxes. With the `value` option
now being an array of values.

<MultiSelect />

## Hidden Input

You can render tiles without a radio/checkbox. Note that the input elements are still underlying the component, but this will limit the visual indication
to the selected states on the tile itself. This is likely best when paired with custom content on the tile.

<HiddenInput />

## Direction

Set the direction (flex) of the tiles. It can be one of `row` or `column` but will also take a `ResponsiveProp` object with either of these values. (see example).

<Direction />

## Title and Description

Acting as the fieldset legend.

<TitleAndDescription />

## Required

Sets the required and aria-required attributes on the options in the group. To avoid confusion as to whether a radio button group is required or not, authors are encouraged to specify the attribute on all the radio buttons in a group. We recommend to avoid having radio button groups that do not have any initially checked controls in the first place, because this is a state that the user cannot return to.

<Required />

## Disabling Options

A `disabled` attribute can be passed inside the `Option` object to disable any particular option.

<DisabledOptions />

## Error

Pass an error (or boolean with no message) to notify a user when something isn't right. Likely paired with `isRequired` in most cases.

<Error />

Pass an `error` to an individual option to indicate that something about that specific option is invalid.

<SingleError />

## Full Width (or lack thereof)

The OptionsTile component has fullWidth (100%) enabled by default but it can be disabled if need be.

<FullWidth />

## Custom Content

The tiles can render custom content with a `render` function passed in the option object.

<CustomContent />

## Component Design Tokens

This component shares component design tokens with all form controls. For a complete list of tokens, see the [Theming Form Controls documentation](/docs/theming-form-controls--custom-theme-form).
