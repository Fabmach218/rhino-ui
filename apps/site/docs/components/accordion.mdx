# Accordion

The accordion component delivers a large amount of information in a small amount of space through progress disclosure. It is ideally used to shorten pages or reduce scrolling when it is not critical that content be fully read.

Accordions are useful when you want to toggle between hiding and showing additional content for related information, such as a Glossary or FAQ.

## Props

## Caret Options

By default the caret is on the right. You can render the caret on the left side so the accordion has a folder structure like appearance using the `hasCaret` prop on the `Accordion.PanelSummary` component.

<LeftCaret />

### No Caret

You can also choose to hide the caret altogether. Moreover, the accordion is a very transparent custom implementation of the `<Details>` component so if more custom behavior is required, you can build your own custom accordions `<Details>` details as well.
