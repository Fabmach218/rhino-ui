# Heading

Use `Headings` as labels for pages or sections of a page that make up an interface. `Headings` can label an entire page, or sections of related content.
The `Heading` component allows you to specify an appropriate semantic element (h1-h6) and independently set its size so that it is appropriate for the surrounding content.
If no size is specified, a default size will be applied.

<Heading as="h1">Lead the world towards a clean energy future</Heading>

## Props


## All Levels

Each Heading level has a default size.

<Levels />

## Sizes

The default size of the Heading can overridden as xs-5xl so that it's appropriate for its surrounding context.

<Sizes />

The `size` prop accepts an object where the properties correspond to [breakpoint tokens](?path=/story/design-tokens-design-tokens--page#breakpoints).

<ResponsiveSizes />

## Colors

The variant of the heading is inherited from its parent, but can be set to brand variant as well.
