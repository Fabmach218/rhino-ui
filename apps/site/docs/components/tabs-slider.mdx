# TabsSlider

The TabsSlider component is a linear set of two or more segments, each of which functions as a mutually exclusive button. Within the component, all items are equal width. This control often used to display different views under the same context.

Limit the number of items to improve usability. Wider segments are easier to tap. On phones, the number of items should be limited to four or fewer segments.

**IMPORTANT**: This component uses DOM refs in order to calculate the width of the selected tab indicator. If you are rendering this inside an element with transitions
that affect width, then it may not correctly size the selected indicator initially. In such cases you can wait until the parent element's
transition is complete with `onTransitionEnd` or `onAnimationEnd` before rendering the `TabsSlider`.

## Props


## Sizes

The `size` prop allows you to specify the size of the slider,
and even make it responsive using the same `ResponsiveProp` pattern as the box, the the available size values.

<Sizes />

## Toggle Switch

A common use case for the TabsSlider as a presentational toggle switch, along with the `TabPanels` component.

<ToggleSwitch />

## With Anchor elements

Since each `TabSlider.Item` is render via a `Box` component you can pass the `as` attribute to render it as a different element than a button.
The only other likely use case is to render each tab as an anchor. See example markup below.

<AnchorElements />
