# Tabs

The Tabs component allows a user to flip amongst different views within the same page. This helps users navigate related content without having to change context.

<Default />

## Props


## With Panels

Use the TabPanels component to also control the visible content based on the selected tab.

<WithPanels />

## Full Width

Use the `isFullWidth` prop to expand the tabs to the width of its parent, and size each tab evenly.

<FullWidth />

## Centered

<Centered />

## Overflow

By default, tabs will overflow when the content is wider than the container. The selected `Tab.Item` will automatically be scrolled into view when the component is first rendered.

<Overflow />

## Sizes

The `size` prop allows you to specify the size of the tab, or the size of the tabs at different breakpoints.

<Sizes />

## With Anchor elements

Since each `Tab.Item` is render via a `Box` component you can pass the `as` attribute to render it as a different element than a button.
The only other likely use case is to render each tab as an anchor. See example markup below.

<AnchorElements />

## Component Design Tokens

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>token name</th>
      <th>default value</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <DesignTokens />
  </tbody>
</table>
